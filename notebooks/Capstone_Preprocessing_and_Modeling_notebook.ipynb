    "Here we see the tradeoff of changing our threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall is just under 0.7 at a threshold of 0.1, which isn't great, and sacrifices precision quite a bit. Obviously, at the threshold 0.01, recall is really high, nearly 0.9, while precision is close to 0. Recall takes a pretty steep dive as precision goes up.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe precision is our more valuable indicator, and I believe we should leave the threshold at 0.5. If we have high recall and low precision, that means we'll be predicting most players that are hall of fame players when they are in fact hall of fame players. However, that means we will also be predicting many players to also be hall of fame players when in fact they are not. The value of this model is in helping us predict what makes players great. If our model catches a high number of non-hall of fame players, it loses that value. Therefore, I'm willing to incorrectly leave out some hall of fame players as being correctly predicted, knowing that those who were predicted are almost certainly actually in the hall of fame.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also makes sense because there are some players that get inducted into the hall of fame for unique reasons or are outliers. Therefore, having a low recall score will likely always be a problem."

    "Overall, our model does what we need it to do. Its accuracy of 98.4% is better than chance. The precision is high at the expense of recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The limitations of this model (and any model most likely) is the inconsistency of why players are inducted into the hall of fame. Some on their in-game play, some simply on winning many championships, some on being the first to do something, and the list goes on. Since our goal was to help teams figure out what makes players successful on the court, I believe we achieved what we desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will miss some players in our predictions, but we can be confident that those we predict as hall of fame caliber are almost certainly that. Therefore, we can examine what makes these players successful and translate that into recruiting and building up players to be successful with their teams."
